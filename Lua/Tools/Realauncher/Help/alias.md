# Alias

## SYNOPSYS
alias [/l] <alias>[=new substitution]

## OPTIONS
/l - list all currently registered aliases

## EXAMPLE
v15=iv 15 -- assigns the command "iv 15" to the alias "v15"
v15       -- removes the alias v15 from the saved configurations.

## README
Aliases can be used in ReaLauncher to perform custom substitutions of commands, much like in the terminal in UNIX machines. 

### The alias name:
- CAN contain numbers or letters
- CANNOT contain special symbols

### The substitution:
- CAN be any string that could be typed into the ReaLauncher
- DOESN'T need to be quoted. Everything after the equal sign ("=") will be considered to be part of the substitution

All aliases are saved to the "aliases.txt" file in the /User folder in the ReaLauncher script directory. The file can be manually edited but be careful not to insert aliases with empty substitutions, as these break the parsing as of now. 

Remember that command's entrance function are executed after the parsing of switches.
